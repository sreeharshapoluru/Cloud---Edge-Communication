This application acts as a medium between the physical devices such as led, sensors, buzzers etc and a app running in the cloud.
A cloud applciation capable of controlling the physical devices has been developed with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The connection between the cloud edge and device is throguh a TCP connection using Python.
The device used for the project was the BeagleBoneBlack with Xinu OS running on it.
A user is capable of controlling the physical devices and the BeagleBoneBlack board with the help of the app using the cloud-edge communication.
